            <h2 id="titles">Effective Date: June 19th, 2020</h2>
            <p id="statements"> This privacy policy (as amended from time to time, the “Privacy Policy”) describes our
                policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of data obtained through your access to
                and use of the services available on the Application and Website (the “Application”) operated by
                ChangeRoom, 40 Cimarron Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (“ChangeRoom”). The use of the Application is
                governed by the Terms of Use. ChangeRoom prepared this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to
                ensuring the privacy and security of the data that you share with us in accordance with our obligations
                under the applicable laws, rules and regulations. ChangeRoom is committed to fully comply with the
                Canadian Regulatory Laws. By accessing the Application or using our services you agree to accept and be
                bound by the current version of this Privacy Policy. In case you do not agree to the current version of
                this Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to continue accessing the Application or using our
                services.<br></br>

                ChangeRoom Sizing “the App” provides a sizing recommendation widget “the Service” to merchants who use
                Shopify to power their stores. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected,
                used, and shared when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.
            </p>


            <h2 id="titles">Personal Information the App Collects</h2>
            <p id="statements"> When you install the App, we are automatically able to access certain types of
                information from your Shopify account: shop information, product related data such as the image and
                order data.<br></br>

                Additionally, we collect the following types of personal information from you and/or your customers of
                <mark class="age">16 years of age</mark> and above once you have installed the App: Information about you and others who may
                access the App on behalf of your store, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and
                billing information; Information about individuals who visit your store, such as their IP address, web
                browser details, time zone, sizing data including age, weight, height and bra size and information about
                the cookies installed on the particular device.<br></br>

                We collect personal information directly from the relevant individual, through your Shopify account and
                using the following technologies: “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
                and often include an anonymous unique identifier. “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and
                collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages,
                and date/time stamps. “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record
                information about how you browse the Site.
            </p>


            <h2 id="titles">How Do We Use Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p id="statements"> We use the personal information we collect from you and your customers in order to
                provide
                the Service and to operate the App. This information will help us provide accurate recommendations to
                your
                customers.
            </p>


            <h2 id="titles">Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p id="statements"> Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and
                regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we
                receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.<br></br>

                Behavioural Advertising As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you marketing
                communications we believe may be of interest to you.<br></br>

                Your Rights If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold
                about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to
                exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.<br></br>

                Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to
                fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or
                otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information
                will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.
            </p>


            <h2 id="titles">Data Retention</h2>
            <p id="statements"> When you place an order through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for
                our
                records for 90 days unless and until you ask us to delete this information.
            </p>

            <h2 id="titles">Changes</h2>
            <p id="statements"> We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example,
                changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
            </p>

            <h2 id="titles">Data Storage, Security And Usage</h2>
            <p id="statements">
                Your personal data is stored either in our database or in those of our service
                providers, located in the Amazon Web Services. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic and
                procedural safeguards to protect our System, including firewalls, individual passwords and encryption
                and authentication technology, and take all other necessary and adequate administrative, organizational,
                technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard the same against unauthorized or unlawful
                processing and use, accidental loss or destruction or damage, theft, disclosure, or modification and to
                ensure its integrity. Please note, however, that data transported over an open network, such as the
                Internet or email, may be accessible to anybody. We cannot guarantee, and are not responsible for, the
                confidentiality of any communication or information transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing
                any Data via an open network, you should consider that it is potentially accessible to others, and
                consequently, may be collected and used by others without your consent. In particular, while individual
                data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not. Even if both the sender
                and recipient are located in the same country, data may be transmitted via such networks to other
                countries regularly and without controls, including countries that do not afford the same level of data
                protection as Canada. Your Data and Information may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by
                unauthorised parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the
                security of the Data and Information during its transfer via Internet.<br></br>


                ChangeRoom will not use your personal Data for marketing purposes, including the distribution of
                promotion emails, and will not sell, rent or otherwise make available any Data submitted by users to any
                third parties without the relevant user’s consent, unless allowed under this Privacy Policy or required
                by law. You authorise ChangeRoom to de-identify your Data and subsequently to copy, process, use,
                publicly disclose and distribute the Data in anonymized form for academic and statistical purposes. Such
                anonymized Data shall no longer be considered as “personal data”. You authorise ChangeRoom to receive,
                review and store technical data (including crash reports) retrieved from the devices you are using to
                access the Application. We reserve the right to disclose Data to the extent we reasonably believe it is
                necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii)
                enforce the Terms, including investigations of a potential violation thereof, (iii) detect, prevent or
                otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or to (v)
                protect the rights, property or safety of ChangeRoom, its users and the public. Please note that
                ChangeRoom uses encryption software that may be subject to export control regulations. The Application
                may contain links to Applications or materials that are not operated by ChangeRoom. Such other
                Applications are not subject to this Privacy Policy and ChangeRoom is not responsible in any way for the
                content or accuracy of such Applications or for the policies applied to the treatment of personal data
                and information. Connecting to or otherwise accessing such Applications is at your own risk.<br></br>


                We recommend that you read the policies used by these Applications, and check how these Applications
                protect your personal data and information and whether they are trustworthy. This Privacy Policy shall
                in all respects be governed by Canadian substantive law. Any dispute arising out of or in connection
                with this Privacy Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ottawa, Canada
                and you consent to such jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to
                inconvenient forum. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will
                be available at our Application (www.changeroom.io). The revised Privacy Policy shall become effective
                from the date of its publication on the Application.
